Before I started the task I planned out my approach, see images attached. Although unit testing was considered, I decided
not to include this because the test did not clearly mention this as a requirement. I took an approach that would have 
allowed me to perform / work with some form of unit testing framework if necessary breaking out key elements of the code
into seperate methods that could be tested to identify points in the code where I felt errors were likely to occur.

The project is written in node therefore simply run 'npm install' to setup and then call 'mlwt <input> <output>' to run
the application. There are two test input files 'test1' and 'test2' plus an example output file. Finally there is an invalid
formatted file included ('invalid') which demonstrated validation working.
